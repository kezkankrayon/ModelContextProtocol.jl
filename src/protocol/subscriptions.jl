# src/protocol/subscriptions.jl
# Modern-era (2026-07-28+) `subscriptions/listen`: the long-lived POST response stream
# that replaces the legacy GET SSE endpoint and `resources/subscribe`/`unsubscribe`.
#
# The listen request never completes normally. Its response route is captured and the
# handler returns `deferred`, so the server loop moves on while notifications are
# pushed onto that route as changes occur. Every message on the stream — the opening
# acknowledgment, each notification, and the closing result — carries the
# subscription's id in `_meta` under `io.modelcontextprotocol/subscriptionId`, which
# is how clients demultiplex streams on stdio (one shared channel) and how they
# correlate them on HTTP.

Serialize a notification for delivery on a `subscriptions/listen` stream, tagging it

    handle_subscriptions_listen(ctx::RequestContext, params::SubscriptionsListenParams) -> HandlerResult

Open a `subscriptions/listen` stream: validate the filter (a malformed one is
rejected with -32602, not silently emptied), send
`notifications/subscriptions/acknowledged` as the stream's FIRST message (carrying the
honored subset of the requested filter), register the subscription, and defer the
request's response — the stream stays open until the client closes it, cancels it
(`notifications/cancelled` on stdio), or the server shuts down (`close_subscriptions!`).

Ack-then-register happens under the registry lock, so a concurrent broadcast can
neither enqueue a change notification ahead of the acknowledgment nor observe a
half-registered stream — and a stream whose ack cannot be delivered is never
registered at all.

Notification types the server cannot deliver are omitted from the acknowledged
filter rather than silently accepted, so a client can tell what it will actually
receive.

Deliver a notification to every `subscriptions/listen` stream that opted into it,
tagged with each stream's own subscription id. Every record — not just the filter
matches — is swept for liveness (`route_alive`), so a disconnected client whose
filter never matches anything still gets pruned. Returns the number of streams the
notification reached.

Delivery happens while holding the registry lock (every delivery path enqueues
without blocking), so a broadcast cannot interleave with a stream's registration or
graceful closure; see the `SubscriptionRegistry` docstring for the lock ordering.

# Arguments
- `server::Server`: The server whose subscriptions to notify
- `method::String`: The notification method
- `params::AbstractDict`: Additional notification params
- `uri::Union{String,Nothing}`: For `notifications/resources/updated`, the resource URI
- `task_id::Union{String,Nothing}`: For `notifications/tasks`, the task id
- `authorize`: Optional per-stream predicate `record::SubscriptionRecord -> Bool`
  checked after the filter match — used by `notifications/tasks` to re-authorize
  each delivery against the stream's stored principal/scopes WITHOUT taking the
  task-store lock here (the ordering store → registry must never reverse)

Deliver a plain JSON-RPC notification to the connected legacy session, if there
is one. The caller passes the session state and transport it already fetched
(one snapshot per announcement — a concurrent restart cannot authorize against
one session and deliver through another). The session must have completed a real
`initialize` handshake: `initialized` alone is not proof (a bare
`notifications/initialized` sets it), so a negotiated `protocol_version` is
required too — a server that only ever served modern requests is never armed
for legacy delivery.

Delivery is transport-polymorphic via `send_notification` — stdout on stdio,
the standalone GET SSE stream on Streamable HTTP. The ambient request route is
explicitly bypassed for the send: when an announcement happens inside a request
handler (legacy or modern), the legacy notification must go out-of-band to the
legacy session's own stream, never onto the calling request's response channel
(which on a modern request would leak it to a different — possibly differently
authenticated — client).

# Arguments

- `transport`: The transport snapshot (`Transport` or `nothing`)
- `method::String`: The notification method
- `params::AbstractDict`: The notification's params

# Returns
- `Bool`: `true` when the transport handoff was attempted without error — NOT
  proof of enqueue or client receipt (a disconnected HTTP transport, or one

Cancel an active `subscriptions/listen` stream by its originating request id — the

carry its id; per JSON-RPC cancellation semantics no response is sent.

Only ROUTELESS records (stream transports like stdio, where the single shared
channel means the cancellation can only come from the stream's own client) are
cancellable this way. A route-bound (HTTP) stream is cancelled by closing the
response stream itself — an in-band cancellation message must never be honored
for it, because on HTTP the notification can arrive on ANY connection: honoring
it would let one client end another client's stream by guessing its id.

End all `subscriptions/listen` streams gracefully: each open stream receives the
JSON-RPC response to its originating listen request (an empty complete result tagged
with its subscription id and carrying `serverInfo` like every other modern result),
which is how a client distinguishes an orderly server shutdown from an abrupt
transport drop. Called during server shutdown.

The closing results are delivered while holding the registry lock, so a concurrent
broadcast can never write on a stream AFTER its graceful result: the broadcast
either completes first or finds an empty registry.

- `server::Server`: The server whose subscriptions to close
