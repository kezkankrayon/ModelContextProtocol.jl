# src/protocol/tasks_ext.jl
#
# The MCP Tasks extension (`io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks`, SEP-2663) — the modern
# era's replacement for the experimental SEP-1686 core tasks. Task creation is
# server-directed: a client declares the extension in its per-request `_meta`
# clientCapabilities, and a tool handler hands off to background execution with
# `task_detach(ctx)`, which delivers a flat `CreateTaskResult` while the handler
# keeps running. Clients poll `tasks/get` (results inlined; there is no
# `tasks/result`), answer mid-task input via `tasks/update`, and cancel with the
# ack-only `tasks/cancel`. The legacy era's task surface is untouched: the two eras
# share the `TaskStore` but records are era-tagged and never served across eras.

Hand the current tool call off to background task execution (MCP Tasks extension,

the tool is task-capable (`task_support` `:optional` or `:required`), and the

terminal state, observable via `tasks/get`.

Returns `false` — and the handler simply continues as an ordinary synchronous
call — when any precondition is absent (legacy-era request, extension not
declared, tool not task-capable). Idempotent: a second call returns `true`
without creating another task.

    task_await_input(ctx, request::InputRequest) -> Any
    task_await_input(ctx, requests::AbstractVector{InputRequest}) -> Vector{Any}

Ask the client for input MID-TASK and block the handler until it answers (tasks
extension, SEP-2663). Callable from a handler that has already detached via
[`task_detach`](@ref): the request(s) are registered under server-minted keys
(unique over the task's lifetime), the task's status flips to `input_required`,
and `tasks/get` surfaces the outstanding requests in `inputRequests`. The client
answers with `tasks/update` `inputResponses`; each response value is returned to
the waiting handler (the vector form returns responses in request order, and only
once ALL of them have arrived — a partial `tasks/update` is accepted, the task
simply stays `input_required` until the rest arrive). Once nothing is pending the
status returns to `working`.

Build requests with [`elicit_request`](@ref), [`sampling_request`](@ref), or
[`roots_request`](@ref) — the same constructors the MRTR flow uses. A server MUST
NOT send input requests the creating request's client capabilities did not
declare, so an undeclared capability throws (failing the task).

Throws [`TaskCancelledException`](@ref) when the task goes terminal while (or
before) waiting. An unanswered request blocks until the client answers or
cancels, or until the task's ttl elapses — a per-wait deadline timer fails an
expired task still parked on client input and unwinds its waiters, so abandoned
tasks cannot pin handler state forever. To distinguish expiry from a client
cancel, check `task_cancelled(ctx)` — `true` only for the latter.

The registered requests are frozen: each request's params are normalized into
an owned plain-JSON snapshot at registration, so a key's content can never
change across polls (the spec's key-stability rule) and the capability check
binds to exactly what will be surfaced. Params must therefore be plain JSON
data — nested dicts/vectors/tuples/sets of strings, numbers, booleans, and
`nothing` (what `elicit_request` and friends naturally produce); anything else
is rejected with an `ArgumentError`.

Before detachment there is no `inputRequests` surface: a handler that needs input
to DECIDE (e.g. whether to proceed at all) returns [`InputRequired`](@ref) for
the MRTR round on the original request instead.

# Arguments
- `ctx`: The request context passed to a ctx-aware handler

Wire the tasks extension's `notifications/tasks` status updates: install the
store's status-change hook so every extension-era transition (parking on input,
resuming, completing, failing, cancelling, expiring) pushes the task's complete
DetailedTask — identical to what `tasks/get` would return at that moment — to
the `subscriptions/listen` streams that subscribed to the task's id.

The hook runs under the store lock (which the wire snapshot requires) but does
NO transport I/O there: it enqueues the snapshot — plus the task's
transition-time principal and `required_scopes`, re-checked per stream at
delivery — onto a bounded FIFO consumed by a single dispatcher task, which
broadcasts OUTSIDE the store lock. A stalled client can therefore never wedge
the task store (a synchronous stdio write under the lock would block every
tasks/* request once the client's pipe fills), the single consumer preserves
transition order, and a full queue load-sheds (best-effort pushes; polling
stays authoritative). Installed by `mcp_server`; `stop!` closes the queue,
ending the dispatcher.

                                tool_scopes::Vector{String}) -> HandlerResult

Run a task-capable modern-era `tools/call` off the serial server loop: capture the
request's response route, spawn the handler on a background Julia task, and defer.
`tool_scopes` is the caller's snapshot of the tool's `required_scopes` — the exact
set this request was authorized against, recorded onto a minted task for
per-request re-authorization. The handler decides the response shape by what it
does first:

- returns without detaching → ordinary synchronous result (the immediate-result
  shortcut), delivered on the captured route
- returns `InputRequired` without detaching → the MRTR round (capability check,
  `input_required` envelope) — this is what lets MRTR exchanges resolve BEFORE
  task creation, per the SEP-2663 composition rule
- calls `task_detach(ctx)` → the `CreateTaskResult` was already delivered; the
  eventual outcome is recorded into the task (a `CallToolResult` completes it,
  a thrown error fails it with the JSON-RPC error inlined)

The worker guarantees exactly one outcome on every path: any throw between the
handler's return and the response delivery — including one raised by a
diagnostic logger — lands in a last-resort catch that answers -32603 (or fails
the already-created task).
